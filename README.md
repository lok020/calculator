# calculator

A simple calculator app as a practice for my logical thinking.

Currently only simple calculation can be done.

Current functional button:
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- clear display
- backspace
- percentage calculation
- decimal calculation
- equal

More functional button will be added into future.

Possible future additional button:
- brackets
- square
- square root
- history
- etc.
